# pencilsketch
* find an image that you want to convert to a pencil sketch with Python. 
* Next, we need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo.

Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details.
* The only library we need for converting an image into a pencil sketch with Python is an OpenCV library in Python. It can be used by using the pip command; pip install opencv-python.
